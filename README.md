## About

This repository is meant to provide tools to convert a HuggingFace Safetensors
model to different deep learning inference engines. This way, it should be
simpler to not only get started with pre-trained deep learning models by
leveraging tools such as Ollama, OpenVino, and vLLM and their respective APIs.

This repository can also be thought of as a tutorial on how to convert models.

## Why Safetensors?

HuggingFace Safetensors is a model format aimed at providing a secure, safe, and
language agnostic format for sharing pre-trained models.

## Supported Deep Learning Inference Engines

This repository currently supports the following deep learning inferene engines:

- Ollama
